# Week 3 Williams Pizza
## Instructions

William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service. For each pizza, he needs to record the following information:

   1. The name of the pizza company, which can consist of more than one word
   2. The diameter of the pizza
   3. The weight of the pizza
Devise a structure that can hold this information and write a program that uses new to allocate a structure (instead of declaring a structure variable). Also have the program request the pizza diameter before it requests the pizza company name. The program should ask the user to enter each of the preceding items of information, and then the program should display that information on a single line. Use cin (or its methods) and cout.
